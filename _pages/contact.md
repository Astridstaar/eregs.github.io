# Contact

eRegulations is an [open source](/technology/#open-source-and-contributing)
project with contributions from both individuals and agencies of the United
States government. As such, general inquires and curiosities can be directed
to the whole group by opening an
[issue](https://github.com/eregs/eregs.github.io/issues/new) in our GitHub
repository.

That said, if you are interested in working with GSA's
[18F](https://18f.gsa.gov) for hosting and customization, contact Will
Sullivan at [will.sullivan@gsa.gov](mailto:will.sullivan@gsa.gov).
