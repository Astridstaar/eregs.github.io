# Contact

eRegulations is an [open source](/technology/#open-source-and-contributing)
project with contributions from both individuals and agencies of the United
States government. As such, general inquires and curiosities can be directed
to the whole group by opening an
[issue](https://github.com/eregs/eregs.github.io/issues/new) in our GitHub
repository.

That said, if you are interested in working with GSA's
[18F](https://18f.gsa.gov) for hosting and customization, contact Will
Sullivan at [will.sullivan@gsa.gov](mailto:will.sullivan@gsa.gov) or [eregs@gsa.gov](mailto:eregs@gsa.gov).

# Governance

The eRegulations project began as a work of the
[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://cfpb.github.io/), but has been
adopted by [several federal agencies](/#live-instances) with significant
contributions from [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/). Along the way, literally
dozens of individuals have contributed code, designs, ideas, and management
across multiple teams. Combine this with the fact that the work product is all
in the public domain and it becomes clear that the project has no single
"owner". Defining direction in this environment is inherently challenging, so
we take a pragmatic approach. 

Day-to-day changes (largely backwards-compatible changes) should be
reviewed by a second set of eyes before merging, but can be merged by anyone
in the `eregs` organization. However, to keep the project moving forward, we
allow the original submitter to merge their own submissions after one week if
there is no dissent.

Larger policy changes and major code shifts warrant additional input from
affected parties. Therefore, such changes should be open for discussion (as an
issue in the eregs.github.io repository) for a minimum of two weeks. During
this time, anyone in the `eregs` organization can _veto_ these changes; this
is a bit of a nuclear option, so we try to avoid it in favor of constructive
dialog. 

We defer defining exactly what "major" and "day-to-day" changes are and how to
avoid deadlock in veto scenarios until the need arises. We use our best
judgement.

In summary:

* Day-to-day changes can be merged by anyone in the org
* Day-to-day changes should not be merged by the submitter unless 1 week has
    passed
* Policy changes should be open for discussion for at least 2 weeks
* Policy changes can be vetoed by any org member
