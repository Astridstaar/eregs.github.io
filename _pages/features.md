# Features

eRegulations includes an illustrated user guide that explains its features. See it live on the [CFPB](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/eregulations/about) and [ATF](https://atf-eregs.app.cloud.gov/about) instances.

### Navigability

While regulations are traditionally represented as monolithic blocks of text, they contain a great deal of embedded structure. eRegulations teases out that structure and uses it to present the text in a clean, readable form.

### Inline interpretations

Many regulation paragraphs have official interpretations that have traditionally been displayed at the end of the regulation, forcing readers to jump back and forth between the regulation and its interpretation. eRegulations parses the interpretations for each paragraph, and displays them under the paragraph or section being interpreted.

### Definitions

We highlight words that have been defined in the regulation, and the user can click on the word and see its definition without scrolling to the part of the regulation that defines that word.

### Internal citations

Internal citations display as clickable links so users can quickly navigate between sections.

### Search

Users can search for keywords across various versions of a regulation.

### Versioning

Regulations are evolving documents and are often displayed as changes to the base text. We present whole versions of regulations for each set of changes and combine Final Rules that have a common effective date into one version.

### Comparing versions

Users can see how a regulation changed in a word-by-word or “redline” comparison view. Changes are expressed as additions (shown in green) or deletions (struck-through, in lighter gray).

### Filter by date

Users can view specific versions of a regulation by the effective date.

### Section-by-section analysis

The notices that compose a version of a regulation contain relevant analyses of the altered sections. We automatically pull that information out and make it accessible while reading the regulation text.

### Responsive design

The application design is responsive, adjusting to the device and screen size of the user.

### Comment on proposed rules

Proposed rules published by the [Federal Register](https://federalregister.gov) can be imported into our interface. Users can compare two versions side-by-side and comment on specific paragraphs or sections of the proposal. [Read more](/features/notice-and-comment).
