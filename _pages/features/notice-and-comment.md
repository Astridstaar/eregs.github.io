# Notice and Comment

During the Spring of 2016, an 18F team expanded the platform again, adding
Notice &amp; Comment functionality that allows users to more granularly
comment on proposed rules -- down to the paragraph level -- and allows
agencies to more easily manage and contextually organize the comments coming
in. The pilot project launches in mid-July with the Environmental Protection
Agencyâ€™s eManifest team.
