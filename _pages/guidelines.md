# eRegulations’ guidelines to writing rules and regulations

## Overview and checklist

- [ ] Follow the standard regulation outline structure.
- [ ] Add any bulleted or numbered lists to the main outline structure of your document.
- [ ] Use the built-in heading structure of your writing software in your document.
- [ ] Use headings consistently and wherever possible.
- [ ] Amend, revise, add to, or remove whole paragraphs.
- [ ] Reference the preamble when creating an amendment and vice versa.
- [ ] Write in language that the average member of the public will understand.

## 1. What is eRegulations?

eRegulations is an open-source platform for making regulations easier to find, read, and understand. We digitally digest agency regulations and rules to present their built-in structure in a clean, readable form, including their changes over time. 

eRegulations Notice & Comment also provides a way for the public to comment on Notices of Proposed Rulemaking in a structured and more precise way. This makes it easier for commenters to respond to specific issues in the rule — down to the paragraph level — and allows agencies to efficiently sort and organize those comments.

## 2. Why is this document important?

### 2.1 Make regulations and notices easier and faster to parse
Following the formatting we outline in this document will allow the eRegulations platform to ingest your proposal or regulation without any problems. This will help to avoid extra manual work and customization on the developer’s part, significantly reducing your agency’s costs.

### 2.2 Regulatory consistency
Every agency has it’s own guidelines and tone for writing regulations, but the public sorts through regulations from many agencies in order to do one thing. The more alike regulations and rules are in structure across agencies, the lower the burden of understanding how to comply. Similarly, when in doubt and when possible, we encourage simple, plain language.

### 2.3 Close adherence to the Federal Register Document Drafting Handbook
First and foremost, we recommend following the [Federal Register Document Drafting Handbook](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/write/handbook/chapters.html). By doing so, the eRegulations platform is able to enhance the data coming from the Federal Register and present it in a more contextual and human-readable format for your audience.

## 3. Formatting and structuring your rule

### 3.1 Format vs. structure
In regulation writing, document “semantics” refer to their _meaning_, as opposed to their _appearance_. For example, this document has two levels of headings. Their _appearance_ involves their font size, weight (for example, bold), etc. while their _semantics_ revolve around the structure they give to the document. For example, this section, “3.1 Format vs structure,” lives _inside_ the “3. Formatting and structuring your rule” section.  That is a _semantic_ structure.

The eRegulations platform is focused on the _structure_ of regulations, Federal Register notices, etc. We know how to split documents into separate pages, link between sections, show historical changes of a regulation over time, and so forth due to understanding the structure of the documents. Using and adding a level of formatting to meaningful headings and subheadings makes the rule easier for the eRegulations platform to parse and organize and for people to read. 

**We recommend that in your regulation writing, you avoid referring to specific formatting details** (such as “see the italic/underlined/bold text in paragraph (b)”) as the final representation may not display them the same way across all versions of your rule, and instead focus on the _semantic_ structure.

Similarly, keep in mind that the “idealized” rule (and the rule that gets printed) is one composed of headers, paragraphs, images, and tables. There is limited support for bulleted lists, nested paragraphs, emphasized text (and similar typographic formatting details), different types of indentation, and so forth. 

By focusing on the _semantic_ structure instead of typographic _formatting_ and limiting the rule to headers, paragraphs, images, and tables, you will guarantee the rule will appear consistent across print, federalregister.gov, and eRegulations.

### 3.2 File formats accepted by eRegulations

eRegulations uses the Federal Register’s XML data to display your agency’s _published_ rules and regulations. 

If you want to use eRegulations for your rule’s notice and comment period, or want to publish a document _before_ it is published in the Federal Register, we recommend the following file types in order of preference:

- _Ideally_
  - XML written in 
    - Document Type Definition (DTD), or 
    - A format that is written with the standards of the Federal Register in mind (i.e. using headers, paragraphs, tables, and images, and not lots of bullet points, indentations, and other styling and formatting)
  - Markdown HTML

- _Realistically_
  - Microsoft Word (.doc or .docx)
    - Using the Word’s built in heading structure within the document.
